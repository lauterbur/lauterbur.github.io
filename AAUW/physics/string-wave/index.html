To see this yourself, you have 2 waveforms in the simulation below:

<p>
The top is A4 (220Hz), as is the bottom initially.  

<p>
But if you drag the yellow ball to the right, you
can decrease the bottom wavelength, equilalent to pressing your finger on the kneck of
a stringed instrument such as a violin. This increases the frequency, and the ratio of
those frequencies is reported.

<p>
 When you hit
"Start", it will oscillate the waveforms and play a tone proportional to the frequencies
(the top waveform stays at 220Hz).

<p>
You can hear the two tones played together, and see
for yourself if you think that the interval (the 2 tones) is more harmonious or not if
the ratio of lengths (which is the same as the ratio of the frequencies) is the ratio
of 2 integers (e.g. 2:1 = 2.000, 3:2 = 1.500, 4:3 = 1.333, 5:4 = 1.250, etc).

<p>
(Note that you can't change the bottom tone to be
greater than 2x the top (A440).)

Why a ratio of integers?  This is of course a subject for neuroscience and psychology.
However, we can probably be confident that the stimulation in the brain from 
hearing more than one musical note will cause interaction between the waves. If the 2 wave frequencies are related by
the ratio of small integers, then pretty quickly the interaction will repeat in a pattern, 
which our brain percieves as harmonious.
